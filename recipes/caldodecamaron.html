            dish that my mother made for many years. It is especially
             good during the winter months as the combination of spices and warmth make 
            for a cozy feel good dish.The recipe shown below is very 
            simple recipe, which is what makes is great. Anyone can 
            make this recipe even withought any cooking experience,
            which just so happens to be my case.

                <li>
                    Add your 10 chilles pulla and 3 tomatillos into a blender 
                    and fill the blender about halfway with water. Blend until smooth. 

                </li>

                <li>Cut up your half onion into medium sized chunks(not too small)
                    and sautee with oil in a large skillet until golden brown.
                </li>

                <li>Add contents of blender into skillet. Plus add 1/2 of a blender more of water 
                    into the same skillet.
                </li>

                <li>Add salt to taste. Add a about 6-7 leaves of Epazote.
                     Let boil.
                </li>

                <li>Once mixture is boiling add shrimp and salmon and let cook fully. Serve

                </li>

                <li>This step is additional, but makes the caldo taste and look 
                    that much better. Chop white onion and cilantro into small 
                    pieces and add to each served plate. 

                </li>

                <li>
                    If you wish to you can heat up some tortillas or white rice to 
                    accompany the dish. I prefer the former, or it can just be eaten
                    as is. Enjoy!!
